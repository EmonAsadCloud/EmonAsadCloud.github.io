<h1> Our Projects </h1>

<p> <h2> Bioinformatics Projects </h2> </p>
<p> <h3> • Symmetrical Uncertainty based Feature Selection and Classification of Microarray data: </h3> In this paper we 
have discussed an effective and fast method for selecting responsible genes for Colon cancer and Leukemia based
on Information Gain and Symmetrical Uncertainty (SU), This filter method removes irrelevant features by ranking 
correlation between feature and class. Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Multilayer Perceptron and other 
well known classifiers to construct the best classification model(s) and to select the most important genes 
from the microarray data set. The whole project was implemented in python software.  </p>
<p> <h3> • Feature Selection using ANOVA F- score: </h3> Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) is a very powerful feature selection 
method and was applied to solve many machine learning problems recently. We have used ANOVA F- score for 
selecting the most informative feature from six microarray dataset i.e. Colon cancer, Leukemia, Central Nervous 
System (CNS), Lung cancer, Leukemia 3 class and Small Round Blue Cell Tumors (SRBCT) data sets. </p>

<p> <h2> Image Identification </h2> </p>
<p> <h3>  •	Rock Paper Scissor Image Data Classification: </h3> The rock, paper and scissor image database contains three
 types of hand images that signify rock, paper, scissor game. Three types of hand images are then preprocessed by
 keras preprocessing tool to rescale, adjust rotation, height or width shifting etc. Then the preprocessed rock, 
paper and scissors images are used to train the convolution neural network using tensorflow algorithms.The whole
 project was implemented in python software, Google Colab was used as a working platform. </p>
<p> <h2> Natural Language Processing </h2> </p>
<p> <h3>   •	Suicidal Tendency Prediction from Twitter Data: </h3> In this work twitter suicidal intention dataset was used 
to build a model to predict suicidal intention of a twitter user from his/her tweet post.At first suicidal 
intention dataset was preprocessed to remove urls, email id, exclamation marks, question marks etc. from the data 
set.The whole project was implemented in python software , Google Colab was used as a working platform.
